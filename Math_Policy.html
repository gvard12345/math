<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>Effective date: August 13th, 2019.</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Introduction</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cool Math knows that you care about how your and your child's personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. By visiting the website or any other linked pages, features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Cool Math in connection therewith (collectively, the "Services"), or using any of our Services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This Privacy Policy covers Cool Math treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Cool Math gathers when you or your child accesses the Services and when you or your child use Cool Math's Services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Cool Math does not own or control, or to individuals that our company does not employ or manage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you are accessing the Service from within the European Union (EU) or you are an EU citizen, please review the and sections below for more information on how your personal data will be processed and the rights you have regarding this processing. How is children's personal information treated?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you are a minor, you may not disclose Personal Information to us. Cool Math only collects limited Personal Information about children ("Children's Personal Information") directly from the parent or guardian who has downloaded our mobile applications or registered on our website. If you are a minor, please do not send any Children's Personal Information about yourself to us, other than what we request from your parent or guardian who registers for the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected Children's Personal Information directly from a minor, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a minor may have provided us Children's Personal Information without parental involvement, please contact us at gvardanyan12345@gmail.com . In this document "Personal Information" shall apply to personal information of individual Service users who are not student registrants. References to "Children's Personal Information" shall only apply to personal information of student users of the Services. General references to "information" shall apply to all users. If you are a minor and your parent has signed up for the Service, you understand that your parent may be able to view all information within or associated with the account, including without limitation progress reports and usage data that tracks your performance on games, assessments and other tests available through the Services. What Personal Information Does Cool Math Collect?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers: Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Services or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected include your age and the category you choose to learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Personal Information Collected Automatically</b></span><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Services or use our services. Our company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Services and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Cool Math only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Services so that we can make the Services appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those Services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Cool Math does not disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Email Communications: We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from our company if your computer supports this type of program. Cool Math uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. When you receive email from Cool Math, you can opt out of receiving further emails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Push Notifications: We may also send parents and teachers practice reminders through our mobile apps. These notifications are intended for grownups only and can only be requested through the parent/grownup sections of our mobile apps. You can opt-out from these notifications or modify the frequency of these notifications at any time through the app or device settings.</span></p>

Company cookies do not collect Personal Information or Children's Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information or Children's Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our website's most attractive features. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Cool Math and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or third parties.
